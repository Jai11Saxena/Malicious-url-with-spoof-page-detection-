# Malicious-url-with-spoof-page-detection
using python and different machine learning algorithms i am training the model on different attributes a link or url can have.
these attributes can be date when url was made, http or https, length of url,path in url.
Using these properties my model is going to decide whether the given url in  malicious or not with accuracy of 95%.
IN this project i have added a new data point which was not there in previous detection algorithms,
i.e fake html page detectection.Like fake phishing page of any popular social media website.
